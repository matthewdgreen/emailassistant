Email triage instructions
=========================

- Prioritize emails from pinned or high-importance senders.
- Students, collaborators, and family are generally high priority.
- Do NOT prioritize or summarize defense invitations, announcements, conference or summit invitations.
- Do NOT summarize broad department-wide emails unless they contain an emergency or urgent action requiring my attention.
- Bulk notifications, newsletters, and automated alerts are lower priority unless they mention deadlines or urgent actions.
- For each important email, create or update tasks that clearly state what I need to do and by when.
- Summaries should be concise but must include:
    * who is writing,
    * what they want,
    * any deadlines, and
    * whether I owe a reply.
- Avoid suggesting replies to emails that are obviously spam or purely informational.
